    <li>2 (8 ounce) boneless rib-eye steaks</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
    <li>1 (16 ounce) package white mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>1 (16 ounce) package cremini mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>3 shallots, diced</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups Arborio rice</li>
    <li>½ cup dry white wine</li>
    <li>6 cups low-sodium chicken broth, divided</li>
    <li>¼ cup butter</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh chives</li>
    <li>sea salt to taste</li>
    <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Directions</h3>
  <hr>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat a sous vide cooker to 132 degrees F (56 degrees C) in a water bath,
      according to manufacturer's instructions.
    </li>
    <li>Season steaks with salt and pepper and place in a vacuum-seal or heavy-duty freezer bag.
      Seal. Drop the bag into the water bath and set timer for 2 hours.
    </li>
    <li>Remove steaks from bag and place on a paper towel-lined plate. Pat dry carefully on both sides.</li>
    <li>Heat canola oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat until it starts smoking.
      Add steaks. Cook until nicely browned on both sides, flipping every 15 to 30 seconds, about 90 seconds total.
      Transfer steaks to a plate; let rest for 10 minutes. Slice thinly against the grain.
    </li>
    <li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large, heavy saucepan over medium-high heat.
      Stir in white mushrooms and cremini mushrooms; cook until soft, about 3 minutes.
      Transfer mushrooms and their liquid to a bowl.
    </li>
    <li>Heat the remaining tablespoon olive oil in the same saucepan over medium-low heat.
      Add shallots and garlic. Cook, stirring constantly, until shallots are tender, about 3 minutes.
      Add rice and increase heat to medium. Cook and stir until rice is pale golden with nearly translucent edges,
      3 to 4 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Pour wine into the rice mixture; cook, stirring constantly, until fully absorbed, about 6 minutes.
      Add 1/2 cup chicken broth; stir until absorbed, about 3 minutes. Add remaining broth, 1/2 cup at a time,
      stirring risotto continuously until liquid is absorbed and rice is tender yet firm to the bite,
      15 to 20 minutes more.
    </li>
    <li>Remove risotto from heat. Stir in mushrooms with their liquid, butter, chives, sea salt,
      and freshly ground pepper. Plate the risotto with strips of steak on the side.
    </li>
  </ol>
